//! # CD-DA (or audio CD) reading library
//!
//! This library provides cross-platform audio CD reading capability,
//! it works on Windows, macOS and Linux.
//! It is intended to be a low-level library, and only allows you read
//! TOC and tracks, and you need to provide valid CD drive name.
//! Currently, the functionality is very basic, and there is no way to
//! specify subchannel info, access hidden track or read CD text.
//!
//! The library works by issuing direct SCSI commands.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```
//! use cd_da_reader::CdReader;
//!
//! fn read_cd() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!   let reader = CdReader::open(r"\\.\E:")?;
//!   let toc = reader.read_toc()?;
//!   println!("{:#?}", toc);
//!   let data = reader.read_track(&toc, 11)?;
//!   let wav_track = CdReader::create_wav(data);
//!   std::fs::write("myfile.wav", wav_track)?;
//!   Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This function reads an audio CD on Windows, you can check your drive letter
//! in the File Explorer. On macOS, you can run `diskutil list` and look for the
//! Audio CD in the list (it should be something like "disk4"), and on Linux you
//! can check it using `cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info`, it will be like "/dev/sr0".
//!
//! ## Metadata
//!
//! This library does not provide any direct metadata, and audio CDs typically do
//! not carry it by themselves. To obtain it, you'd need to get it from a place like
//! [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/). You should have all necessary information
//! in the TOC struct to calculate the audio CD ID.
